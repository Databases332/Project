#Github Basics
If you are developing on windows download the following software https://desktop.github.com/ and install it.
When it is installed you will be promted to sign in or sign up for github, if you don’t have an account with github, make one now and sign in.

1.	Press the Plus sign on the upper left, select Clone and search for “StudentScheduler” then hit the clone button at the bottom of the dialog.
2.	The repo will appear on the left panel
3.	Clicking on the repo will give you access to information, for instance click the repo, and then history(at the top) and it will show you all changes made so far.
4.	Go ahead and make some change to the README file (it can be anything, doesn’t need to be useful or relevant)
5.	Now view the changes tab of StudentScheduler and you’ll see your change 
6.	Fill out the Summary and Description fields with a summary that starts with TEST (so we know to ignore it)
7.	Now hit commit

9.	Hit the Sync button on the top right to push your changes to the repo.

Tips
•	Try to hit sync whenever you begin working, this will make sure your code is always up to date with everyone elses’ changes
•	Try to group commits into meaningful chunks, not just huge loads of unrelated code changes
•	Always use descriptive commit messages
